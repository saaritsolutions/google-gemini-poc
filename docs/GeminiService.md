## File: `Services/GeminiService.cs`

### 1. File Overview

This file defines the `GeminiService` class, which serves as the primary interface for interacting with the Google Gemini API within the `GoogleGeminiAgent` application. Its core purpose is to facilitate sending user prompts and conversation history to the Gemini API, processing the AI's responses, and managing the necessary API configurations and error handling. It acts as the bridge between the application's logic and Google's generative AI capabilities.

### 2. Key Components

#### Class: `GeminiService`

*   **Implements**: `IGeminiService`
*   **Description**: A service responsible for all communications with the Google Gemini API. It encapsulates the logic for constructing API requests, sending them, and parsing the responses, while also integrating with logging, configuration, and conversation management.

#### Constructor

```csharp
public GeminiService(
    HttpClient httpClient,
    IOptions<GeminiConfiguration> config,
    ILogger<GeminiService> logger,
    IConversationManager conversationManager)
```

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `httpClient` (HttpClient): An instance of `HttpClient` for making HTTP requests. This is injected, typically configured for the application's needs.
    *   `config` (IOptions<GeminiConfiguration>): Provides access to application-specific Gemini API configuration settings (e.g., Base URL, API Key, Model).
    *   `logger` (ILogger<GeminiService>): An instance for logging information, warnings, and errors specific to the Gemini service.
    *   `conversationManager` (IConversationManager): An injected service responsible for retrieving and potentially managing conversation history.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Initializes private fields with injected dependencies.
    *   Extracts `GeminiConfiguration` from `IOptions`.
    *   Calls `ConfigureHttpClient()` to set up the injected `HttpClient`.

#### Private Method: `ConfigureHttpClient()`

```csharp
private void ConfigureHttpClient()
```

*   **Description**: Sets the base address and default request headers (e.g., User-Agent) for the injected `_httpClient`. This ensures all requests made via this client have consistent base settings.
*   **Note**: This method is called during the service's construction.

#### Public Method: `GenerateContentAsync(string prompt, string? conversationId = null)`

```csharp
public async Task<AgentResponse> GenerateContentAsync(string prompt, string? conversationId = null)
```

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `prompt` (string): The user's current input text to send to the Gemini API.
    *   `conversationId` (string?, optional): An identifier for the ongoing conversation. If provided, the service attempts to retrieve previous messages associated with this ID.
*   **Returns**: `Task<AgentResponse>`: An `AgentResponse` object indicating success or failure, and containing the generated content if successful.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Logs the incoming prompt for debugging/auditing.
    *   Retrieves conversation history using `_conversationManager` if a `conversationId` is provided.
    *   Delegates the actual API call to `GenerateContentWithContextAsync`, passing the prompt and retrieved history.
    *   Includes robust `try-catch` error handling, logging exceptions, and returning a failed `AgentResponse`.

#### Public Method: `GenerateContentWithContextAsync(string prompt, List<ConversationMessage> history)`

```csharp
public async Task<AgentResponse> GenerateContentWithContextAsync(string prompt, List<ConversationMessage> history)
```

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `prompt` (string): The current user prompt.
    *   `history` (List<ConversationMessage>): A list of previous messages in the conversation to provide context to the AI.
*   **Returns**: `Task<AgentResponse>`: An `AgentResponse` object containing the Gemini API's response or error details.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Constructs the Gemini API request payload using the `BuildRequest` method.
    *   Constructs the full API endpoint URL, including the model and API key.
    *   Serializes the request payload to JSON.
    *   **Crucially, creates a *new* `HttpClient` instance for the API call.** (See Technical Considerations)
    *   Sends a POST request to the Gemini API.
    *   Checks the HTTP response status code:
        *   If unsuccessful, reads and logs the error content from the API, then returns a failed `AgentResponse`.
        *   If successful, deserializes the JSON response into a `GenerateContentResponse` object.
    *   Processes the deserialized response using `ProcessResponse`.
    *   Includes `try-catch` for network or serialization errors.

#### Public Method: `IsServiceAvailableAsync()`

```csharp
public async Task<bool> IsServiceAvailableAsync()
```

*   **Returns**: `Task<bool>`: `true` if the Gemini API is reachable and responds successfully to a test prompt with any of the configured/fallback models; `false` otherwise.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Attempts to connect to the Gemini API using a predefined list of models, starting with the configured model and falling back to common Gemini models (`gemini-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`).
    *   Constructs a minimal test `GenerateContentRequest` ("Hello").
    *   Builds the full API URL for each model.
    *   Serializes the test request to JSON.
    *   **Attempts to use a *new* `HttpClient` with the full URL, falling back to the injected `_httpClient` with a relative URL if the first attempt fails.** (See Technical Considerations)
    *   Logs detailed information about the availability check, including API key (partially masked), base URL, and request JSON.
    *   Provides informative logging for success, warnings for non-success responses, and errors for exceptions during the check.
    *   Returns `true` on the first successful connection and response, `false` if all attempts fail.

#### Private Method: `BuildRequest(string prompt, List<ConversationMessage> history)`

```csharp
private GenerateContentRequest BuildRequest(string prompt, List<ConversationMessage> history)
```

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `prompt` (string): The current user prompt.
    *   `history` (List<ConversationMessage>): The conversation history.
*   **Returns**: `GenerateContentRequest`: A structured object representing the payload to be sent to the Gemini API.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Constructs the `Contents` array for the API request.
    *   Adds up to the last 10 messages from the `history` to the `Contents` list, mapping `ConversationMessage` roles to Gemini API roles (`user` or `model`).
    *   Appends the current `prompt` as a `user` role message.
    *   **Note**: The code explicitly comments out `GenerationConfig` and `SafetySettings` to match a "working Postman format," indicating a deliberate choice to simplify the request body.

#### Private Method: `GetDefaultSafetySettings()`

```csharp
private List<SafetySetting> GetDefaultSafetySettings()
```

*   **Returns**: `List<SafetySetting>`: A predefined list of `SafetySetting` objects configured to block medium and above harmful content categories.
*   **Responsibility**: Provides a default set of safety settings for API requests.
*   **Note**: As per the `BuildRequest` method's comments, this method is currently *not used* in the active API request construction.

#### Private Method: `ProcessResponse(GenerateContentResponse? response)`

```csharp
private AgentResponse ProcessResponse(GenerateContentResponse? response)
```

*   **Parameters**:
    *   `response` (GenerateContentResponse?): The deserialized response object received from the Gemini API.
*   **Returns**: `AgentResponse`: A simplified, application-specific response model.
*   **Responsibilities**:
    *   Checks if the Gemini API response contains valid candidates. If not, returns an unsuccessful `AgentResponse`.
    *   Extracts the text content from the first candidate's first part.
    *   Constructs an `AgentResponse` object, populating its `Content`, `IsSuccessful`, `Timestamp`, `MessageId`, and `Metadata` fields based on the Gemini response.

### 3. Dependencies

#### Internal Project Dependencies:

*   **`GoogleGeminiAgent.Configuration.GeminiConfiguration`**: Configuration class holding API base URL, key, and default model.
*   **`GoogleGeminiAgent.Models.*`**:
    *   `AgentResponse`: Standardized application response model.
    *   `ConversationMessage`: Represents a single message in a conversation.
    *   `GenerateContentRequest`, `GenerateContentResponse`, `Content`, `Part`, `SafetySetting`: Models representing the structure of requests and responses to/from the Google Gemini API.
*   **`GoogleGeminiAgent.Services.IGeminiService`**: The interface this class implements, defining its public contract.
*   **`GoogleGeminiAgent.Services.IConversationManager`**: Interface for managing conversation history persistence.

#### External Libraries/Frameworks:

*   **`System.Net.Http`**: Provides `HttpClient` for making HTTP requests.
*   **`Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`**: Provides `ILogger` for structured logging.
*   **`Microsoft.Extensions.Options`**: Provides `IOptions` for accessing configuration values via dependency injection.
*   **`System.Text.Json`**: Microsoft's built-in high-performance JSON serializer/deserializer. Used for converting C# objects to JSON payloads and vice-versa.
    *   `System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer`
    *   `System.Text.Json.JsonNamingPolicy`
    *   `System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonIgnoreCondition`
*   **`System.Text`**: Provides `Encoding` for `StringContent`.

### 4. Architecture Notes

*   **Dependency Injection (DI)**: The `GeminiService` class heavily relies on DI for its dependencies (`HttpClient`, `IOptions<GeminiConfiguration>`, `ILogger`, `IConversationManager`). This promotes loose coupling, testability, and adherence to the Inversion of Control principle.
*   **Configuration as Code**: Gemini API settings are externalized into `GeminiConfiguration` and injected via `IOptions`, making the service easily configurable without code changes.
*   **Layered Architecture**: The `GeminiService` acts as a service layer component, abstracting the complexities of direct API interaction from higher-level application logic.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Each public method includes `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle exceptions during API calls or data processing, ensuring that errors are logged and appropriate `AgentResponse` objects are returned.
*   **API Model Encapsulation**: The service uses internal models (e.g., `AgentResponse`, `ConversationMessage`) which simplify the data structures consumed and produced by the service, shielding external callers from the specifics of the raw Gemini API models.
*   **Conversation Context Management**: The service integrates with an `IConversationManager` to incorporate historical context into API calls, enabling multi-turn conversations. The hardcoded limit of 10 messages provides a basic form of context window management.
*   **API Availability Check**: The `IsServiceAvailableAsync` method provides a valuable health-check mechanism for the Gemini API, attempting multiple models for resilience.

### 5. Usage Examples

#### 5.1. Service Registration (e.g., in `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`)

```csharp
// Program.cs (Minimal API example)
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using GoogleGeminiAgent.Configuration;
using GoogleGeminiAgent.Services; // Assuming these are defined in your project

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// 1. Configure Gemini settings
builder.Services.Configure<GeminiConfiguration>(
    builder.Configuration.GetSection("Gemini"));

// 2. Register HttpClient (usually as a singleton, or via IHttpClientFactory)
// Best practice: Use IHttpClientFactory for managing HttpClients
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<IGeminiService, GeminiService>(); // Registers HttpClient and GeminiService

// 3. Register ILogger (automatically handled by Host builder)
// 4. Register IConversationManager (example - replace with your actual implementation)
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IConversationManager, InMemoryConversationManager>(); // Or a database-backed manager

// 5. Register GeminiService itself (already done via AddHttpClient above if GeminiService takes HttpClient)
// If it took a raw HttpClient, you might do: builder.Services.AddScoped<IGeminiService, GeminiService>();

var app = builder.Build();

// ... other app configuration ...
```

#### 5.2. Consuming `GeminiService` (e.g., in a Controller or another Service)

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using GoogleGeminiAgent.Services;
using GoogleGeminiAgent.Models;

namespace GoogleGeminiAgent.Controllers;

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class AgentController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IGeminiService _geminiService;
    private readonly ILogger<AgentController> _logger;

    public AgentController(IGeminiService geminiService, ILogger<AgentController> logger)
    {
        _geminiService = geminiService;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Handles a new prompt for the Gemini agent.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="request">The prompt request, including text and optional conversation ID.</param>
    /// <returns>The agent's response.</returns>
    [HttpPost("prompt")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> SendPrompt([FromBody] AgentPromptRequest request)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(request.Prompt))
        {
            return BadRequest("Prompt cannot be empty.");
        }

        _logger.LogInformation("Received prompt for conversation {Id}: {Prompt}", request.ConversationId, request.Prompt);

        AgentResponse response = await _geminiService.GenerateContentAsync(request.Prompt, request.ConversationId);

        if (response.IsSuccessful)
        {
            // In a real app, you'd likely save the user prompt and agent response to history here
            _logger.LogInformation("Agent response for conversation {Id}: {Content}", request.ConversationId, response.Content);
            return Ok(response);
        }
        else
        {
            _logger.LogError("Failed to get agent response for conversation {Id}: {Error}", request.ConversationId, response.ErrorMessage);
            return StatusCode(500, response); // Or a more specific error code
        }
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Checks if the Gemini service is available.
    /// </summary>
    [HttpGet("status")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetServiceStatus()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Checking Gemini service availability.");
        bool isAvailable = await _geminiService.IsServiceAvailableAsync();
        if (isAvailable)
        {
            return Ok("Gemini service is available.");
        }
        else
        {
            return StatusCode(503, "Gemini service is currently unavailable.");
        }
    }
}

public class AgentPromptRequest
{
    public string Prompt { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string? ConversationId { get; set; }
}
```

### 6. Change Impact

**Changes Made:**

```

**Impact:**

*   **No Functional Change**: This modification is purely to the XML documentation comment of the `GeminiService` class. It does not alter the runtime behavior, logic, or performance of the application in any way.
*   **Documentation Improvement**: The change adds "with enhanced documentation generation capabilities" to the class summary. This is a minor, stylistic enhancement to the generated documentation (e.g., from tools like Sandcastle or IntelliSense) for the `GeminiService` class. It clarifies the service's role specifically in a context where documentation is a priority. While a small change, it reflects a commitment to clearer communication within the codebase.

### 7. Technical Considerations

*   **HttpClient Management (Critical Issue)**: The `GenerateContentWithContextAsync` and `IsServiceAvailableAsync` methods create *new* `HttpClient` instances (`using var httpClient = new HttpClient();`) for each API call. This is a well-known anti-pattern in .NET applications. `HttpClient` is designed to be a long-lived object, and creating new instances repeatedly can lead to "socket exhaustion," where the application runs out of available network sockets, causing connection failures and performance degradation over time.
    *   **Recommendation**: Refactor these methods to consistently use the `_httpClient` instance injected into the constructor. If different base addresses are truly needed, consider using `IHttpClientFactory` to manage named clients or pass the full URI to `_httpClient` methods. The current fallback logic in `IsServiceAvailableAsync` exacerbates this by creating two new clients.
*   **API Key Security**: While the API key is partially masked in logs (`***`), ensure that the API key is never hardcoded directly into source control. It should be managed securely through environment variables, Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or similar secure configuration providers.
*   **Missing Safety Settings/Generation Config**: The `BuildRequest` method explicitly comments out the inclusion of `GenerationConfig` and `SafetySettings`. While this was done to "match working Postman format," it means the Gemini API is running with its default (potentially less strict) safety settings and without specific generation parameters (like temperature, max tokens, etc.).
    *   **Recommendation**: Re-evaluate if `GenerationConfig` and `SafetySettings` should be included. If they are intended to be used, uncomment the relevant lines in `BuildRequest` and use the `GetDefaultSafetySettings()` method or make them configurable. If not, consider removing `GetDefaultSafetySettings()` to avoid dead code.
*   **Hardcoded Conversation History Limit**: The `TakeLast(10)` limit for conversation history in `BuildRequest` is hardcoded.
    *   **Recommendation**: Make this limit configurable (e.g., via `GeminiConfiguration`) to allow for easy tuning of context window size without code changes.
*   **Rate Limiting and Retry Policies**: There are no explicit mechanisms for handling API rate limits or transient network errors (e.g., retries with exponential backoff).
    *   **Recommendation**: For a production application, implement a retry policy (e.g., using Polly or a custom implementation) and consider rate limiting strategies if high throughput is expected.
*   **Error Message Granularity**: The `ErrorMessage` in `AgentResponse` directly exposes `ex.Message` or raw API error content.
    *   **Recommendation**: For user-facing errors, consider transforming these into more generic, user-friendly messages while retaining the detailed technical error in logs.
*   **Asynchronous Best Practices**: The methods correctly use `async` and `await`, which is good practice for I/O-bound operations like network calls.
